> "Yeah mate, I knew [[Roland Jaquard]]. A real dandy he was, always after them women. He was here last night to pick up Leticia. She wasn't the first he's been here for. Last year he was courting Amelia Lorenzo, that year's star. He liked them dark beauties, he did."
> "So, Miss Garcia and Jaquard were seeing a lot of each other?"
> "Yes, sort of. Not as much as Jaquard would have liked, methinks. Leticia is a fun-loving girl. She has many admirers and she takes advantage of it. Mr. Jaquard wasn't the only man in her life, even though he wanted to be. Funny, isn't it? A man like Jaquard could have as many women as he wanted. I guess that's why he tried so hard to get the ones he couldn't have."
> "You seem to know quite a lot about the lives of these people."
> "I've been a stage-hand for twenty-five years and have seen many dramas unfold on the stage, but I also watched them unfold backstage, and real-life drama is much more interesting. I study it."
> "Have your studie revealed who the other men are in Miss Garcia's life?"
> "As I said, she was a fun-loving girl and she had fun with a lot of men, but there where three that she saw more than the others. One was Roland Jaquard, who you know about. Of the others, Marco Escobedo, the pugilist, was a frequent caller as was Sir Lester Ogilvie. Of course, I only see the callers that come to the stage door."
> "Do you have any idea who would have wanted to kill Jaquard?"
> "No, I don't. I only watch the dramas, I don't write them."
> "Thank you, Mr. Parrish."
