> Wai Fang Gong, landlord of the Celestial Garden Apartments, is a small, stout, round-faced man. His smiling face radiates the Oriental optimism that allows him to give his dirty, ramshackle dwelling such an ethereal name.  
> "He not here. He go way," is Gong's response to our question about Curtis Twiggs.  
> "Can we see his room?"  
> "You want room?"  
> "No! We want to see Twiggs' room."  
> "Him no have room. Him go way. Give up room. Four day ago."  
> "Do you know where he went?"  
> "No. He leave bag with me. Be back for bag. No know when."  
> "Can we see the bag?"  
> "You pay see bag?"  
> WIggins takes a coin from his pocket and hands it to Gong. Gong waddles through the doorway and into his room. We follow. The room we enter looks like some thing out of the Emperor's Palace. It is immaculately clean. Silk paintings hang from the wall, beautifully carved ebony furniture is tastefully arranged on a large brown rug with a fire-breathng green dragon design.  
> "I get bag." Gong goes over to one of the cabinets which line the right wall. Opening one of the doors he removes a tattered black bad and brings it over to us.  
> "No take no thing. Twig kill me. Bad man.  
> "We no take, we won't take anything. We just want to look.  
> We open te bag and remove the following items: One gold watch with "C.A." engraved on the back; several pieces of jewellery and rings; four wallets with identification in the names of Charles Attard, Wilfrid Robarts, Nathan Revell and Rory Winslow; and lastly, a 7-inch stiletto with a pearl handle.  
> Wiggins replaces the items in the bag and hands it back to the landlord. "Thank you, Mr. Gong."
